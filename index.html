        <h1>Welcome to Excel Form Editor website !</h1>
        <aside>A program made to help you fill forms in excel. 
		If you wanted to fill it in by yourself, you would have to write 1 letter at a time and then change the cell manually.
		<p>EFE makes this task a peace of cake.</p> </aside>
    </header>
	
    <h2>How does it work?</h2>	
    <p>In order to let the program know which fields you want to fill, you`ll have to color-code them. 
		Just select a bunch of cells and change their background to some color,
		then select other field and color it with different color, then keep alternating them (like: red->black->red),
		those could be any colors, the program only cares that they are different, to identify the start of the new field.
		The program then generates a config file for your form, which contains information about all of the fields you chose(colored).
